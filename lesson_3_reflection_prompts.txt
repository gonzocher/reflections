When would you want to use a remote repository 
rather than keeping all your work local?

I like the remote possibility because I use different 
computers during the day.  Using a remote repository 
keeps all of my files in easy access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

I don't know.  I would like the automatic version I think.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

If I want to help Becca with her Set Game project, I go to her github.  There I fork her Set Game.  
It shows up in my GitHub.  To work on the code, I want to clone it onto my local computer.  After making changes, I 
can push it back to my GitHub.  I would use a branch to try something different?  
before committing it into the main project?

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

People can work on GitHub.  No one can work on my local directory.  I have more control there.  
If something gets messed up on GitHub, I still have a last known state of the remote stored locally.
Smart!
