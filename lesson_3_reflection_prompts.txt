When would you want to use a remote repository 
rather than keeping all your work local?

I like the remote possibility because I use different 
computers during the day.  Using a remote repository 
keeps all of my files in easy access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I don't know.  I would like the automatic version I think.
