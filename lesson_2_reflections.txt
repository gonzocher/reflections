What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The directory receives a hidden file .git that makes it able to be tracked in git.  Without that file, 
git does not recognize the directory and is unable to do anything with it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It seems that you have files in a working directory.  When you want to move it into your repository, it moves it first
to the staging area, I guess as a way to verify your intention.  When you see it, then you move it.  I am not sure of
the value yet.
